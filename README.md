***Work fearlessly with pointers in Go***

## Project Description

`package pointer` is a *tiny*, simple and obvious library helping you to always work safely with pointers and avoid the dreaded `nil pointer dereference` ðŸš€

## Installation

To use this project in your code:

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/pointer@latest
```

And then simply:

```go
import "github.com/FollowTheProcess/pointer"
```

## Quickstart

Using `pointer` is so easy, you already know how to do it!

```go
import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/FollowTheProcess/pointer"
)

func main() {
    var s *string // nil

    // More code here, you've forgotten `s` is nil by now!
    // but pointer has you covered!
    str := pointer.Or(s, "hello")

    fmt.Println(str) // "hello"

    // We just want the zero value if it's nil
    fmt.Println(pointer.OrDefault(s)) // ""
}
```

`pointer.Or` will return the pointer it's passed in **only** if it's not nil! Otherwise you'll get back the value you provided.

If you just want the zero value instead, use `pointer.OrDefault`
